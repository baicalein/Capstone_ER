# Notebooks

This folder contains exploratory and validation notebooks.

Use this space to:
- Inspect and understand FHIR schemas
- Explore synthetic or local FHIR datasets
- Validate assumptions before formalizing code
- Prototype ideas before moving logic into modules

Notebooks here are **non-production** and may be incomplete or experimental.
